# 💡 About Me
Hi😊! I’m Junxiang Luo, a passionate and curious student at **SCUT** (South China University of Technology) based in vibrant Guangzhou, majoring in software engineering now. As an eager learner and problem solver, I’m fascinated by the endless possibilities in **Computer Science**, especially in cutting-edge fields like **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Vision**, where technology meets creativity to solve real-world problems.  
  
I’m currently particularly interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence, especially in areas such as image synthesis and visual recognition. As I advance in my studies, I aspire to explore both the theoretical underpinnings and real-world applications of these technologies. I’m also eager to broaden my knowledge across diverse areas of computer science — from machine learning to intelligent systems — in pursuit of a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of the field.  
  
I’m proficient in C++, Qt, and Python, and have a foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m currently expanding my skill set by learning Java and C#. To strengthen my theoretical and practical foundation, I’ve completed Harvard’s CS50 and am now preparing to study CS61B (Data Structures), MIT 6.036 (Introduction to Machine Learning), and Discrete Mathematics (MATH1071).  
  
Beyond academic study, I actively take part in competitions to challenge myself and apply what I’ve learned. I’m also drawn to emerging technologies and enjoy working with like-minded peers on meaningful projects. When I’m not coding or studying, I love traveling — exploring new places and cultures not only helps me recharge, but also sparks creative ideas and fresh perspectives.  
  
If you’re interested in discussing shared research interests, potential collaborations, or simply exchanging ideas, feel free to contact me at [junxiangluo0@outlook.com](junxiangluo0@outlook.com) I’m always open to meaningful conversations and new opportunities.

# 📝 Publications 
As an undergraduate student in Software Engineering, I am currently devoted to laying a strong academic and technical foundation. While I have not yet published any research papers, I am deeply passionate about conducting work that is both meaningful and impactful. I believe that true contributions come not from haste, but from quiet accumulation and deep reflection — a conviction that meaningful research must be built upon solid understanding and patient exploration. In the future, I hope to make substantial and lasting contributions to emerging fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics.
